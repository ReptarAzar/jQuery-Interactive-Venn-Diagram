Special thanks:
Greg Levallee (@elgreg) - Although I think my amature questions annoy the shit out of you, thanks for your patience teaching me the basics of terminal and Git. 
John Resig (@jeresig) - Thanks for creating jQuery. I recently met Remy (@remy_d) who apparently lived on your floor at RIT.
Paul Irish (@paul_irish) - Thanks for all your work on the @h5bp all my projects start with it and a new Git repo.
