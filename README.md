##Special Thanks

[Greg Levallee](http://twitter.com/elgreg) - Although I think my amateur questions annoy the shit out of you, thanks for your patience teaching me the basics of terminal, Git, and Java Script. 
[John Resig](http://twitter.com/jeresig) - Thanks for creating jQuery. I recently met Remy (@remy_d) who lived on your floor at RIT.
[Paul Irish](http://twitter.com/jeresig) - Thanks for all your work on the @h5bp all my projects start with it and a new Git repo.
